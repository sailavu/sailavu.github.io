Why is it that some businesses make it hard to leave their products or services? Gyms, phone, insurance companies come to mind to name a few. Twice I was completely satisfied with a company's service, except for the pain to leave them and as a result I would never consider them again. So what must they do?

Aim to have as few dents in the brand value as they possibly can. Then the next question is - what is brand value? Not easy to give a generalised answer. In my opinion it's the sum of all experiences with a product or service. Of those experiences a customer signing up, being happy, being unhappy and exiting are probably the more prominent ones.

Some companies such as 37signals, Amazon with AWS to name a few manage this well. I have gone back to their services after stopping their use completely. Because they were secure enough to respect my choice and made the exit process simple, which in return improved their brand value.

A customer leaving might put a dent in this month's quota, sure give them a sweetener to stay on, but don't lose them forever. 

To boil it down further make the exit process just as easy if not easier than the sign up process and you're set.

What do you think?
