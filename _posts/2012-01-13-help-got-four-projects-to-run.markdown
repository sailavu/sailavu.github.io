We all more than likely have multiple projects going on at the same time. It's quite difficult to switch context especially when you are involved with a technical task.

It hasn't typically worked out when I thought oh I'll get this one job done first properly and then jump onto the next one. Mostly because we underestimate the time it takes to get the job done and the longer the disconnect the harder it is to get back in again. 

So what's an effective way out (at least what works for me)?

<!-- more -->

1. List out what needs doing, then prioritise it. [Trello](www.trello.com) is proving brilliant for that.

2. Timebox your tasks. Spend X amount of time on a task and move on to the next one. Combine it with [Pomodoro Technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) perhaps.

3. Communicate to folk about what's on your plate and what you are doing. Don't expect people to magically figure out that you have 10 things to do now and that they should temper their expectations.

4. Ditch meetings. Easier said than done, so perhaps request 45 min session instead of an hour or pick up the phone or walk over to someone's desk to sort it out.

5. Most importantly expect having to do multiple things concurrently. Instead of fighting it get efficient at it, again easier said than done and I still struggle with it. But I complain a lot less.
