Software engineers are a tough lot and take lot of pride in their work. On the flip side they sometimes don't know when to ask for help. Having been a team lead and member I've noticed a few simple questions/steps serve fairly well. Best to show it with an example:

__*Task: Get login via Facebook working*__

__*Ask yourself: Have I done this before?*__

<!-- more -->

## The good

If the answer is no then ask the team immediately: __*Has anyone done this before or has ideas to solve it?*__

Just simply ask the above question first and then get onto doing your research. Consider it as fire and forget or async or whatever else you want to label it.

Collate your team's feedback and your research and figure out how you're going to solve the task.

Put the plan of action out there again for critique and get feedback from your team. 

And typically start working on the problem while the team gets back to you.

## The bad

If the answer is no then start doing your research.

Once you've spent 20 mins max (pick your own limit) on researching ask the folk on your team.

## The ugly

If the answer is no then start doing your research.

Once you've spent 20 mins max (pick your own limit) on researching then start trying out things to prove any ideas or hypotheses you may have.

Once you've explored a few dead ends you ask your team for help.

You collate your team's feedback and your research and figure out how you're going to solve the task.

Start trying out things again based on new info at hand.

And so on...


Btw, you can replace the question "Have I done this before?" with other ones like "I tried this approach twice with no success. What gives?" or "It used to work but now it doesn't. What am I missing?".

In my experience most folk don't fall in the ugly bucket but in the bad bucket. Very very few fall in the good bucket.

__*Key is to ask for help as soon as we get stuck. Granted that in a lot of cases Google and StackExchange can sort you out fairly quickly but you get the point.*__
